# Automate your Home/Office      
_This application helps to control electronic devices remotely. This can be installed in your localnetwork, and if you have a static IP you can access your devices from any where. You need a WiFi/Ethernet at Home/Office to connect Arduino devices. Then from your phone, you can control connected appliances_    

> This app is tested using Google Chrome in both Windows 10 and Android only      

1. This support PWA [Progressive Web App]. So this can be easily installed into any OS supporting PWA
1. The Arduino code for the devices is also included in the [Hardware](https://github.com/ajumalp/Smart-Home/tree/master/Smart-Access/Hardware) folder. 
1. Mainly supporting [ESP8266](https://github.com/Erratums/ESP8266/wiki) devices 
1. You are always free to modify the code for your requirements

## Installing Software    
1. Install XAMPP with Apache MySQL [Download here](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
1. Install Mosquitto MQTT [Doanload here](https://mosquitto.org/download/)
1. Download the complete source code and place it inside XAMPP/htdocs folder. [You should place it inside a folder say "sa"]
1. Make sure XAMPP is installed properly and also Apache and MySQL is working. Link [localhost/phpmyadmin](http://localhost/phpmyadmin/) should open MySQL Manager 
1. Inside the [res/db](https://github.com/ajumalp/Smart-Home/tree/master/Smart-Access/res/db) fodler you can see the query to create the tables. 
1. Execute this query in [phpmyadmin](http://localhost/phpmyadmin/server_sql.php). You can see the tables created      
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajumalp/Smart-Home/master/Other/Images/Screenshots/sql-tables.png)      
1. The MySQL user and password will be automatically set in the above query. If you want to set a different password, you can change it in the config file 
1. Now run the **mosquitto.exe** file in the **mosquitto** folder you installed earlier 
1. It should be ready now. Open the [**index.html**](http://localhost/sa/index.html) in the [htdocs/sa](http://localhost/sa/) folder in your Google Chrome. [I tested this in Google Chrome only, so I suggest you to use Google Chrome]
1. You will see the Main Screen now. You should move to **Devices** screen and add device before adding switchs.

**There are different types of ESP8266 modules. Here we are mainly using the ESP01S with the relay relay modules**      
      
> If you don't know how to install ESP8266 into Arduino IDE, please refer this link    
[**_How to install ESP8266 in Arduino_**](https://github.com/ajumalp/Smart-Home/wiki/How-to-Install-esp8266-on-Arduino)

</table>      
You need a USB to TTL Converter to program ESP01S or you can buy any ESP01S programmer or you can also program ESP01S using [TTL converter in] Arduino Uno as shown.     

**_Please note: In the above image, the Tx or Arduino is directly connected to Rx of ESP01S which not recomended for long time use. You should use a 5v to 3v3 logic converter_**     
       
Once you have the programmer or TTL to USB converter you can start programming ESP01S     

1. Go to [Hardware](https://github.com/ajumalp/Smart-Home/tree/master/Smart-Access/Hardware) folder
1. Open the **SS-ESP01S.ino** in Arduino IDE
1. Select the Board Type as **ESP8266 Generic**
1. Select the port 
1. Upload the code
